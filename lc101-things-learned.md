# Things I've Learned from LaunchCode

Nuggets of knowledge I've gained from 3+ months of LaunchCode programming bootcamp.

## Technologies Learned
- Git/GitHub (VCS)
- Python 3 + Flask
- HTML, CSS, MySQL (Relational Databases)
- Java, Spring Boot, IntelliJ IDE
- HTTP Methods: GET & POST Requests & Status Codes
- Front & Back-End Programming. Client & Server-Side.


## Computer Science Theory & Computational Thinking

- Model View Controller (MVC)
- Seperation of Concerns: A foundational computer science principle. Each part of the system addresses a unique concern.
- Object-Oriented Programming & Design
- Pair Programming. Driver and navigator analogy.
- Problem Space & Solution Space

### Git/GitHub VCS (Version Control System)
- Git Cycle: Edit/Render/Commit
- Push, Pull, Branching, & Merging.
- Work on one feature at a time.
- Stage and commit a feature when it's ready. Don't push with incomplete or broken code.




## Programming Wisdom
- Intrinsic/Extrinsic Motivators. Having an intrinsic motivation is important to why you do what you do. Otherwise it will be pointless and you will burnout in the longrun. (Service/Purpose, Mastery, & Autonomy).
- "It's how you tell your story."
- The "Four T's" = Tools, Technology, Technique, & Teamwork
- "Make it work, make it good, than make it fast."
- "Programming is more than the language. It is the libraries, the tools, and the community."
- Steps to Solving a Problem. 1. Read/Talk 2. Research 3. Think. "Agree to what is the definition of success. Test against that."
- Documentation. Stuff written for experts by experts who have forgotten what it's like to be a newbie.
- Small Steps, small victories, constant victories!
- "Just code crap! Don't worry about what others think of your GitHub. It's important to be active."
- Keep your code skinny! Constant refactoring. Maintained and clean!
- Persistence pays off.
