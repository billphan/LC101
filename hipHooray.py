# Classic Interview Problem The problem is famously used in job interviews. See if you can figure it out! Loop through the numbers between 1 and 20. If a number is divisible by 3, print Hip. If the number is divisible by 7, print “Hooray”.

for i in range(1,20,3):
  print("Hip"),
else: 
  print("hooray")
